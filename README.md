The Python calculator program performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It operates through a text-based menu, allowing users to select the desired operation and input two numbers for calculation.

Features:
Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: Includes error handling for division by zero.
User Interaction: Uses a menu-driven approach to interact with the user, providing options and requesting inputs.
Loop for Multiple Calculations: Allows users to perform multiple calculations in one session until they choose to exit.
Functions:
add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y.
multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x divided by y, with error handling for division by zero.
Main Logic:
Displays a menu for selecting an operation.
Reads user input for operation choice and numbers.
Performs the selected operation using appropriate functions.
Displays the result.
Asks the user if they want to perform another calculation.
Exits if the user chooses not to continue.
This calculator is a fundamental example of a console-based application in Python, useful for understanding basic programming concepts and user interaction.
